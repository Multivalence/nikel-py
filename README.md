# nikel-py

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/nikel-py.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/nikel-py/) [![Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/nikel-py.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/nikel-py/) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/Multivalence/nikel-py.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/Multivalence/nikel-py)

A modern, easy to use, async and sync API wrapper for the nikel API written in Python.

## Key Features

- Gather Data about UofT Courses, Programs, Textbooks, Services, and more
- Gather Data asynchronously so main event loop isn't blocked

## Installation

**Python 3.6 or higher is required**

```shell
#Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U nikel-py

#Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U nikel-py
```

## Current list of endpoints

- Courses
- Programs
- Textbooks
- Examples
- Evals
- Food
- Services
- Buildings
- Parking


## Methods

- ```get(query : Dict, limit : int=10)``` Synchronous
- ```async_get(query : Dict, limit : int=10)``` Asynchronous

## Basic Examples

### Synchronous

```py
from nikel_py import Courses

'''
Creates a list (limited to 1) of courses that have the name "Introduction to Computer 
Programming"
'''

x = Courses.get({'name' : 'Introduction to Computer Programming'}, limit=1)

print(x[0].code)

# >> CSC108H1
```

### Asynchronous

```py
import asyncio
from nikel_py import Textbooks

async def main():
    
    #Creates a list (limited to 1) of Textbooks that have the ID '10552179'
    x = await Textbooks.async_get({'id' : '10552179'}, limit=1)
    print(x[0].name)
    

asyncio.run(main())

# >> Where The Wild Things Are
```

## Advanced Examples (Filtering & Extra Fields)

### Synchronous

```py
from nikel_py import Foods

query = {
    'coordinates.latitude' : 43.66332,
    'attributes' : '~Gluten Free'
}

'''
Creates a list (limited to 10) of Restaurants that provide Gluten Free Foods and have 
a latitude of 43.66332
'''

x = Foods.get(query, limit=10)

print(x[0].name)

# >> Second Cup Kiosk
```

### Asynchronous

```py
import asyncio
from nikel_py import Programs

async def main():
    
    query = {
        'campus' : 'St. George',
        'name' : '(Computer Science'
    }
    
    '''
    Creates a list (limited to 1) of Programs that start with Computer Science and 
    are done at the St. George Campus
    '''
    
    x = await Programs.async_get(query, limit=1)
    print(x[0].type)
    

asyncio.run(main())

# >> major
```

## Filters
| Operator | String | Numerical/Boolean |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
|  | Fuzzy Search | Equality |
| = | Equality | Equality |
| ! | Inequality | Inequality |
| < | N/A | Less than |
| <= | N/A | Less than or equal to |
| \> | N/A | Greater than |
| \>= | N/A | Greater than or equal to |
| ( | Starts with | N/A |
| ) | Ends with | N/A |
| ~ | Serialization | N/A |

*Note: the `~` operator essentially "yolos" and tries to search within nested arrays and hard to navigate nested structures.*

**Note: All Objects listed below have an `all_data` property which returns every property in JSON format.**
